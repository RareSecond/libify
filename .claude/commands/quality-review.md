# üîç QUALITY REVIEW: TDD-Focused Quality Assurance

**Current Phase**: Quality Assurance
**Previous Phase**: Implementation
**Next Phase**: Documentation
**TDD Focus**: Verify test-driven development practices and coverage

## Instructions

I'm now in QUALITY REVIEW mode with TDD verification at the center. This is MANDATORY after implementation. I must:

1. **Verify TDD practices** - Ensure test-first approach was followed
2. **Run comprehensive tests** - Execute all test suites
3. **Analyze test coverage** - Check coverage metrics and quality
4. **Run TypeScript compilation** - Verify no type errors
5. **Run ESLint** - Check for linting errors and warnings
6. **Run Prettier** - Verify code formatting
7. **Review all changes** - Comprehensive change examination
8. **Check git status** - Identify ALL modified files (including side effects)
9. **Verify TDD cycle compliance** - Ensure Red-Green-Refactor was followed
10. **Fix any issues** - All quality checks must pass

## TDD Verification Commands

Run these commands to verify TDD practices:

```bash
# TDD Coverage Analysis
npm run test:cov          # Comprehensive test coverage
npm run test:cov:report   # HTML coverage report

# Test Execution
npm run test              # All unit tests
npm run test:watch        # Watch mode for development
npm run test:e2e          # End-to-end tests (if applicable)
```

## Quality Commands

Run these commands in parallel for efficiency:

```bash
npm run typecheck    # TypeScript compilation
npm run lint         # ESLint check
npm run prettier:check # Prettier formatting
git status --porcelain # All modified files
git diff --name-only   # Scope of changes
```

```

## TDD Verification Process

### 1. Test-First Verification
- Check git history for test commits before implementation
- Verify test files exist for all production code
- Ensure tests fail before implementation

### 2. Coverage Analysis
- Run comprehensive coverage analysis
- Check line, branch, and function coverage
- Verify coverage quality vs. quantity

### 3. TDD Cycle Compliance
- Verify Red-Green-Refactor pattern was followed
- Check for minimal implementations
- Ensure refactoring was performed

## What I Will Do

1. Verify TDD practices were followed throughout implementation
2. Run comprehensive test coverage analysis
3. Check that tests were written before production code
4. Verify Red-Green-Refactor cycle compliance
5. Run all quality checks in parallel
6. Execute all relevant tests
7. Review every modified file thoroughly
8. Verify requirements are fully met
9. Check for code quality and conventions
10. Identify ALL modified files (including side effects)
11. Fix any TDD or quality issues immediately
12. Provide comprehensive TDD quality review report
13. Only proceed when all checks pass

## What I Won't Do

- Skip TDD practice verification
- Ignore test coverage requirements
- Proceed with insufficient test coverage
- Skip quality verification
- Ignore warnings or errors
- Proceed with failing checks or tests
- Skip reviewing any changes
- Miss generated or side-effect files
- Approve changes with problems
- Make assumptions about TDD compliance

## TDD Success Criteria

- All production code has corresponding tests
- Tests were written before implementation
- Red-Green-Refactor cycle was followed
- Test coverage meets minimum thresholds (90%+)
- Tests verify behavior, not just coverage
- Code quality standards are met
- All tests pass

## Available Commands for TDD Verification

- **`/test-coverage`** - Comprehensive coverage analysis
- **`/tdd-cycle`** - Verify TDD cycle compliance
- **Standard quality commands** - TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier

## Next Steps

When all TDD practices are verified and quality checks pass, use `/doc-update` to update documentation with TDD insights.
