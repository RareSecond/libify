# ‚û°Ô∏è TASK PROGRESSION: Moving to Next Task

**Current Phase**: Implementation
**Purpose**: Controlled task progression

## Instructions

I'm using task progression control. I must:

1. **Verify current task completion** - Ensure previous task is fully done
2. **Update TodoWrite** - Mark current task as completed
3. **Identify next task** - Know what comes next in the approved plan
4. **Request permission** - Get explicit approval to proceed
5. **Focus on one task** - Only work on the next approved task

## Task Progression Checklist

- [ ] **Previous task completed** - No partial work left behind
- [ ] **TodoWrite updated** - Previous task marked as completed
- [ ] **Next task identified** - Know exactly what's next
- [ ] **Permission requested** - Asked for explicit approval
- [ ] **Ready to proceed** - All prerequisites met

## Task Progression Format

```
Task [X] completed! 

Previous task: [Description of completed task]
Next task: [Description of next task]

May I proceed with Task [X+1]?
```

## What I Will Do

1. Confirm previous task is fully completed
2. Update TodoWrite with completion status
3. Identify the next task in the approved plan
4. Request explicit permission to proceed
5. Wait for approval before starting next task

## What I Won't Do

- Proceed without explicit permission
- Skip task completion verification
- Work on multiple tasks simultaneously
- Change the approved task order
- Add tasks not in the original plan

## Next Steps

After permission is granted, continue with implementation. When all tasks are complete, use `/quality-check`.
