# âœ… SCOPE VERIFICATION: Getting Approval

**Current Phase**: Scope Verification
**Previous Phase**: Planning
**Next Phase**: Implementation

## Instructions

I'm now in SCOPE VERIFICATION mode. I must:

1. **Present the complete execution plan** from the planning phase
2. **Verify scope boundaries** - confirm nothing is missing or extra
3. **Get explicit approval** - user must confirm before proceeding
4. **Clarify any uncertainties** - resolve unclear requirements

## Approval Format

I will present the plan using this format:

```
EXECUTION PLAN:
- Task 1: [File] - [Specific action]
- Task 2: [File] - [Specific action]
- ...
- Task N: Quality Verification - TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier checks
- Task N+1: Documentation Update - Update CLAUDE.md and project docs

Do you approve this execution plan? Should I proceed with Task 1?
```

## Scope Verification Checklist

- [ ] **Complete plan presented** - All tasks clearly listed
- [ ] **Quality checks included** - TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier verification
- [ ] **Documentation updates planned** - CLAUDE.md and project docs
- [ ] **Scope boundaries clear** - No ambiguity about what will be done
- [ ] **User approval requested** - Explicit confirmation required

## What I Will Do

1. Present the complete task breakdown
2. Highlight any assumptions or decisions made
3. Ask for explicit approval using the required format
4. Wait for user confirmation before proceeding

## What I Won't Do

- Start implementation without approval
- Make changes to the plan without user input
- Proceed with unclear or disputed requirements
- Skip the approval step

## Next Steps

Once approval is received, use `/implement` to begin task execution.
