# üìñ WORKFLOW HELP: Test-Driven Development Guide

**Purpose**: Comprehensive TDD-centered workflow guidance and command reference
**Core Philosophy**: Test-driven development at the center of all development activities

## TDD-Centered Workflow Overview

This system enforces a structured development workflow with Test-Driven Development (TDD) at its core across four main phases:

1. **üîç Analysis** - Test-first requirements analysis and strategy planning
2. **üöÄ Implementation** - TDD cycle execution (Red-Green-Refactor)
3. **üîç Quality Assurance** - TDD practice verification and coverage analysis
4. **üìö Documentation** - Test-driven insights and commit preparation

## Phase-by-Phase Commands

### üîç Analysis Phase (Test-First Thinking)
- **`/analyze`** - Start by understanding requirements, codebase, and test strategy
- **`/plan`** - Create detailed task breakdown with TDD approach
- **`/scope`** - Verify scope and test expectations before proceeding

### üöÄ Implementation Phase (TDD Execution)
- **`/implement`** - Execute approved tasks using TDD cycles
- **`/checkin`** - Pause for developer review after 2-3 TDD cycles

#### TDD Cycle Commands
- **`/tdd-cycle`** - Complete Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- **`/test-first`** - Write failing test (RED phase)
- **`/make-green`** - Minimal implementation (GREEN phase)
- **`/refactor`** - Code quality improvements (REFACTOR phase)
- **`/task-next`** - Move to next task after completion

### üîç Quality Assurance Phase (TDD Verification)
- **`/quality-review`** - Verify TDD practices, coverage, and code quality
- **`/test-coverage`** - Analyze test coverage and quality

### üìö Documentation Phase (Test-Driven Insights)
- **`/doc-update`** - Update project documentation and CLAUDE.md with TDD insights
- **`/commit-prep`** - Prepare commit message covering all changes

### üõ†Ô∏è Utility Commands
- **`/reset-workflow`** - Reset to analysis phase for new work
- **`/status`** - Show current workflow phase and task progress
- **`/help-workflow`** - This comprehensive TDD guide

## TDD-Centered Workflow Rules

### üö´ Enforced TDD Restrictions
- **No production code** without failing tests first
- **No code changes** without approval
- **One task at a time** during implementation
- **Mandatory TDD cycles** for all code changes
- **Mandatory check-ins** after every 2-3 TDD cycles
- **Mandatory TDD verification** after implementation
- **Minimum 90% test coverage** required
- **Documentation updates** for all significant changes
- **Complete commit messages** covering all changes

### ‚úÖ Required TDD Process
1. Always start with `/analyze` (including test strategy)
2. Create plan with `/plan` (TDD approach)
3. Get approval with `/scope` (test expectations)
4. Execute with `/implement` using TDD cycles:
   - Use `/tdd-cycle` for complete Red-Green-Refactor
   - Or use `/test-first` ‚Üí `/make-green` ‚Üí `/refactor`
   - Use `/checkin` every 2-3 TDD cycles
   - Use `/task-next` when task complete
5. Verify TDD compliance with `/quality-review`
6. Analyze coverage with `/test-coverage`
7. Update docs with `/doc-update`
8. Prepare commit with `/commit-prep`

## Key TDD Benefits

- **Enforced TDD workflow** - No skipping Red-Green-Refactor cycles
- **Test-first development** - All code driven by tests
- **High code quality** - Continuous refactoring and improvement
- **Comprehensive coverage** - Minimum 90% test coverage enforced
- **Clear progress** - Always know current phase and TDD cycle
- **Quality assurance** - Mandatory TDD verification and coverage analysis
- **Documentation** - Test-driven insights captured for future work
- **Controlled scope** - Explicit approval required with test expectations
- **Consistent commits** - Proper commit messages with TDD compliance
- **Rapid feedback** - Fast test cycles for immediate validation
- **Maintainable code** - Well-tested, refactored, and documented

## TDD Quick Start

1. **New task**: `/analyze` ‚Üí understand requirements and plan test strategy
2. **Create plan**: `/plan` ‚Üí detailed task breakdown with TDD approach
3. **Get approval**: `/scope` ‚Üí user confirmation with test expectations
4. **Execute TDD cycles**: `/implement` ‚Üí use TDD cycles:
   - `/tdd-cycle` for complete Red-Green-Refactor
   - `/test-first` ‚Üí `/make-green` ‚Üí `/refactor` for granular control
5. **Verify TDD compliance**: `/quality-review` ‚Üí TDD practices and coverage
6. **Analyze coverage**: `/test-coverage` ‚Üí comprehensive coverage analysis
7. **Document insights**: `/doc-update` ‚Üí update docs with TDD learnings
8. **Commit**: `/commit-prep` ‚Üí prepare message with TDD compliance

## TDD Command Reference

### Core TDD Commands
- **`/tdd-cycle`** - Complete Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- **`/test-first`** - Write failing test (RED phase)
- **`/make-green`** - Minimal implementation (GREEN phase)
- **`/refactor`** - Code quality improvements (REFACTOR phase)
- **`/test-coverage`** - Analyze test coverage and quality

### Workflow Commands
- **`/analyze`** - Test-first requirements analysis
- **`/implement`** - TDD-driven task execution
- **`/quality-review`** - TDD verification and coverage analysis
- **`/status`** - Current workflow and task status

## Remember: TDD-Centered Development

This workflow system transforms Test-Driven Development principles into enforced, step-by-step commands that ensure consistent adherence to TDD practices. The system:

- **Enforces test-first development** - No production code without failing tests
- **Guarantees Red-Green-Refactor cycles** - Proper TDD cycle execution
- **Ensures high test coverage** - Minimum 90% coverage requirement
- **Maintains code quality** - Continuous refactoring and improvement
- **Provides rapid feedback** - Fast test cycles for immediate validation
- **Creates maintainable code** - Well-tested, refactored, and documented

Each command builds on the previous one, creating a controlled and predictable TDD workflow that puts tests at the center of all development activities.
