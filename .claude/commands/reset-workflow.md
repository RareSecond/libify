# ðŸ”„ RESET WORKFLOW: Start Fresh

**Action**: Reset workflow to analysis phase
**Purpose**: Start new workflow cycle

## Instructions

I'm resetting the workflow to start fresh. This command:

1. **Clears current state** - Resets workflow to analysis phase
2. **Clears task tracking** - Removes current TodoWrite entries
3. **Prepares for new work** - Ready to analyze new requirements
4. **Preserves learnings** - Keeps CLAUDE.md documentation intact

## Reset Actions

- **Workflow phase**: Reset to "analysis"
- **Current task**: Reset to "none"
- **Task list**: Clear TodoWrite entries
- **Approval status**: Reset to "pending"

## When to Use Reset

Use this command when:
- Starting a completely new feature or task
- Previous workflow was interrupted or incomplete
- Need to start over with different requirements
- Beginning a new work session

## Reset Confirmation

```
ðŸ”„ WORKFLOW RESET COMPLETE

## What I Will Do

1. Reset workflow state to analysis phase
2. Clear current task tracking

5. Confirm reset completion

## What I Won't Do

After reset, use `/analyze` to begin new workflow cycle.
