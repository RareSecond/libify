# üîç ANALYSIS EXPERT: Feature Breakdown

**Purpose**: Break features into small slices that users can use immediately
**Next**: Use `create-issues.md` after approval to create Notion epic and tasks

## Focus: Analysis & Discussion Only

This command focuses purely on:
- Analyzing requirements
- Designing usable vertical slices
- Presenting findings for discussion
- Refining based on feedback
- Getting approval before proceeding

**Note**: After approval, use `create-issues.md` to create Notion epic and tasks

## Core Principles

### 1. Immediately Usable Features
Every slice MUST deliver something users can:
- **See in the UI** - visible changes they can interact with
- **Use right away** - working functionality, even if limited
- **Build upon** - each slice enhances what came before

### 2. Small, Focused Tasks
Each Notion task should be:
- **1-3 hours of work** maximum
- **Self-contained** - can be completed independently
- **User-facing** - delivers visible value
- **Single responsibility** - does one thing well

### 3. Vertical Slices (Always Working)
Break features into slices that:
- **Work end-to-end** from the first PR
- **Are manually usable** immediately after merge
- **Build progressively** on each other
- **Use mocking** when it speeds delivery

## Analysis Process

### Step 1: Understand the Feature
```markdown
## Feature Analysis
- What users need to do
- Current user experience
- How to enhance it
- Technical approach
```

### Step 2: Design Usable Slices
```markdown
### Slice 1: Minimal Usable Feature (~X hours)
- **Users can**: [specific action they can take]
- **They'll see**: [what appears in the UI]
- **How to use**: [exact steps to try the feature]
- **Implementation**: [technical approach]

### Slice 2: Enhanced Experience (~X hours)
- **Users can now**: [additional capabilities]
- **Improvement**: [how it's better than Slice 1]
- **How to use**: [steps to try new features]
- **Builds on**: Slice 1 functionality

### Slice 3: Complete Feature (~X hours)
- **Users get**: [full feature set]
- **Final touches**: [polish and completeness]
- **How to use**: [complete user flow]
- **Production ready**: All edge cases handled
```

### Step 3: Present for Discussion
```markdown
## Proposed Implementation Plan

I've analyzed [feature] and propose [N] immediately usable slices:

**After Slice 1** (~X hours):
Users can [specific action], they'll see [specific UI change]

**After Slice 2** (~X hours):
Users can additionally [enhanced action], improving [aspect]

**After Slice 3** (~X hours):
Users have the complete [feature] with [final capabilities]

Each slice works immediately after deployment.
Does this breakdown deliver value quickly enough?
```

### Step 4: Get Approval & Next Steps

After presenting the analysis:
1. Wait for user feedback and approval
2. Refine slices if needed based on discussion
3. Once approved, inform user to use `create-issues.md`

The analysis should provide all information needed for epic and task creation:
- Clear slice descriptions
- User value for each slice
- Technical approach
- Time estimates
- Implementation order

## Common Patterns

### Frontend-First Pattern (Fastest to User Value)
```
Slice 1: Working UI with mocked data (1-2 hours)
- Users can: See and interact with the new feature
- Implementation: Component with hardcoded/mocked data
- Value: Immediate visual feedback and interaction

Slice 2: Persistent data (1-2 hours)
- Users can: Save their changes and see them persist
- Implementation: Connect to real backend
- Value: Their work is saved

Slice 3: Polish & edge cases (1 hour)
- Users get: Loading states, error handling, validation
- Implementation: Production-ready refinements
- Value: Smooth, reliable experience
```

### Backend-with-UI Pattern (When Backend is Simple)
```
Slice 1: Minimal end-to-end (2-3 hours)
- Users can: Perform basic action through UI
- Implementation: Simple API + basic UI
- Value: Complete working feature

Slice 2: Enhanced functionality (1-2 hours)
- Users can: Do more advanced operations
- Implementation: Additional endpoints + UI options
- Value: More powerful feature

Slice 3: Production ready (1 hour)
- Users get: Fast, reliable, polished experience
- Implementation: Optimization and error handling
- Value: Professional quality
```

## Key Questions During Analysis

1. **What's the smallest thing users can actually use?**
2. **Can users try this feature after the first PR?**
3. **Does each slice deliver visible progress?**
4. **Are we using mocks to deliver value faster?**
5. **Is the first slice small enough to ship today?**

## What I Will Do

1. Analyze requirements thoroughly
2. Design slices users can use immediately
3. Focus on user-facing value first
4. Present clear breakdown for discussion
5. Refine based on user feedback
6. Keep slices small (1-3 hours max)

## What I Won't Do

- Create Notion tasks (use create-issues.md)
- Skip the discussion phase
- Create backend-only slices with no UI
- Make users wait for multiple PRs to try features
- Build infrastructure without user value
- Proceed without user approval

## Success Criteria

- Every slice is immediately usable
- Users see progress after each PR
- First slice delivers value in hours, not days
- Each slice builds on the previous
- Total feature completed in 3-5 small PRs

## Output Format

```
üîç ANALYSIS COMPLETE

Feature: [name]
First usable slice: ~[X] hours
Total delivery: [N] slices, ~[Y] hours

After Slice 1, users can: [immediate value]
After Slice 2, users can: [enhanced value]
After Slice 3, users have: [complete feature]
