# ðŸ“‹ PLANNING PHASE: Creating Execution Plan

**Current Phase**: Planning
**Previous Phase**: Analysis
**Next Phase**: Scope Verification

## Instructions

I'm now in PLANNING mode. Based on my analysis, I need to:

1. **Break down the work** into the smallest possible tasks
2. **Specify exact changes** - file names, function names, specific modifications
3. **Order tasks logically** - dependencies and sequence matter
4. **Estimate complexity** - identify challenging tasks
5. **Plan quality checks** - what needs to be tested/verified

## Planning Requirements

Each task must specify:
- **File path** - exact file that will be modified
- **Specific action** - what exactly will be changed
- **Expected outcome** - what the result should be
- **Dependencies** - what must be done first

## Task Format

```
Task N: [File] - [Specific action]
- Dependencies: [List any prerequisite tasks]
- Outcome: [Expected result]
- Complexity: [Simple/Medium/Complex]
```

## Planning Checklist

- [ ] **All tasks identified** - Nothing is missing
- [ ] **Tasks are specific** - Each task is clear and actionable
- [ ] **Dependencies mapped** - Task order is logical
- [ ] **Quality checks planned** - TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier verification included
- [ ] **Documentation updates planned** - CLAUDE.md and project docs considered

## What I Will Do

1. Create comprehensive task breakdown
2. Specify exact files and changes for each task
3. Include quality verification as mandatory tasks
4. Plan documentation updates
5. Present complete execution plan

## What I Won't Do

- Start implementation
- Make assumptions about user preferences
- Skip quality verification planning
- Create vague or unclear tasks

## Next Steps

Once planning is complete, use `/scope` to verify scope and get approval.
