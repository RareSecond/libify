# SpotLib - Advanced Spotify Library Management System

## Project Overview

SpotLib is an advanced library management system for Spotify that provides users with granular control over their music collection. Drawing inspiration from iTunes' powerful library management features, SpotLib extends Spotify's capabilities by introducing user-defined tags, detailed play count tracking, star ratings, and intelligent playlist creation based on multiple criteria.

## Core Features

### 1. Track Tagging System
- **Multi-tag Support**: Users can assign multiple tags to any track (e.g., "workout", "summer", "chill", "nostalgic")
- **Tag Management**: Create, edit, delete, and organize tags
- **Tag-based Filtering**: Browse library by tags or tag combinations
- **Bulk Tagging**: Apply tags to multiple tracks simultaneously

### 2. Play Count Tracking
- **Explicit Tracking**: Accurate play count for each track in user's library
- **Historical Data**: Track play patterns over time
- **Play Statistics**: View most/least played tracks, play trends
- **Integration**: Sync with Spotify's play history while maintaining local counts

### 3. Star Rating System
- **5-Star Scale**: Rate tracks from 1-5 stars
- **Quick Rating**: Rate directly from player or library view
- **Rating Analytics**: View average ratings, rating distribution
- **Bulk Rating**: Rate multiple tracks at once

### 4. Smart Playlists
- **Dynamic Creation**: Playlists that automatically update based on criteria
- **Multiple Criteria**: Combine tags, ratings, play counts, date added, genre, etc.
- **Complex Logic**: Support AND/OR operations between criteria
- **Examples**:
  - "5-star tracks tagged 'workout' played more than 10 times"
  - "Added in last 30 days with rating â‰¥ 4 stars"
  - "Tagged 'nostalgic' OR 'throwback' with play count < 5"

### 5. Enhanced Library Management
- **Advanced Search**: Search by any combination of metadata, tags, ratings
- **Sorting Options**: Sort by play count, rating, date added, etc.
- **Library Statistics**: Overview of library size, play patterns, ratings
- **Export/Import**: Backup and restore library metadata

## Technical Architecture

### Backend (NestJS)
- **Database Models**:
  - Extended User model with Spotify integration

- **API Endpoints**:
  - `/tracks` - CRUD operations for track metadata
  - `/tags` - Tag management and track associations
  - `/ratings` - Rating submission and retrieval
  - `/play-history` - Record and query play counts
  - `/playlists/smart` - Smart playlist creation and management
  - `/library/stats` - Library analytics and statistics

- **Services**:
  - SpotifyService - Integration with Spotify Web API
  - LibraryService - Core library management logic
  - PlaylistService - Smart playlist generation
  - SyncService - Synchronization with Spotify data

### Frontend (React + Vite)
- **Views**:
  - Library Dashboard - Overview and quick actions
  - Track Browser - Browse with filters, tags, ratings
  - Tag Manager - Create and organize tags
  - Smart Playlist Builder - Visual criteria builder
  - Analytics Dashboard - Play patterns and statistics
  - Settings - Sync preferences, export options

- **Components**:
  - TrackList with inline rating/tagging
  - TagSelector with autocomplete
  - RatingWidget (star display/input)
  - SmartPlaylistCriteria builder
  - PlayCountDisplay with history graph

### Data Synchronization
- **Spotify Integration**:
  - OAuth flow for authentication (existing)
  - Periodic sync of user's Spotify library

  - Two-way playlist sync (optional)

- **Local Storage**:
  - Cache frequently accessed data
  - Offline support for viewing library
  - Queue sync operations when offline

## User Experience Flow

1. **Onboarding**:
   - Login with Spotify (existing)
   - Initial library import from Spotify
   - Introduction to tagging and rating features

2. **Daily Usage**:
   - View personalized dashboard
   - Quick rate/tag while listening
   - Browse by tags or smart playlists
   - Track play statistics update automatically

3. **Library Organization**:
   - Bulk tag sessions for organizing
   - Create smart playlists for different moods/activities
   - Export library data for backup

## Technical Requirements

### Performance
